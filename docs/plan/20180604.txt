Priorities for Core Functionality:
*Station is able to take in data and represent that station.
*SubwayLine takes in data from the csv and constructs a line, with correct order of the stops.
*Driver class should be able to take in user input and locate specific stations and the fastest route. 

Most Crucial Jobs:
0. We need to be able to take data from the csv and construct a SubwayLine. This includes taking the data we need, making sure it is in the correct order and creating the links in between. 
1. We are using a depth-first and backtracking algorithm to find the best path between two stations. We will need to write code that can navigate from one Station to the next, and evaluates the shortest path.
2. We need to find a way of connecting SubwayLines to each other at certain Stations.


The user is asked to input a start station. User enters first the subway line that they wish to begin at (a list of options is displayed), and then a numbered list of the subway stations on this line will appear. They enter the number, and this will correspond to their start station. 
The same will happen to determine the destination station.

Then, a depth first algorithm will run: 

Depth first Algo:
- If the next Station is null and current Station is not the destination or the departure station, stop. 
- If current# of stops < min# of stops, stop.
- If current station is destination, current# of stops = min # of stops. Stop.
- Call this method on all possible next stations (use search method to find station in other SubwayLines) with current# of stops +=1. 
- Also, recursive: solving from the next possible spot, unless that spot is a disqualifier such as it has already been visited.



Core Functionality: 
1. Having Stations, and SubwayLines that are connected to each other through certain Stations (which can be viewed as nodes).
2. Having a functional depth-first and backtracking algorithm that determines the best path between two points. In the most simple version, the best path means that path that requires the fewest stops. To calculate time between two stations, we can in a simple version assume that travelling from one Station to another is two minutes, and then return the travel time.
3. Taking user input to identify the start and end point

Non-Essential: 
1. We can factor in a number of variables such as geographic coordinates and borough to determine a more realistic travel time between two points.
2. We can add as many SubwayLines as possible (we are starting off with only a few).

Tasks that can be delegated:
* Data processing so that the csv can be converted into Stations
* Adding a travel time
* Adding SubwayLines
* Other features that could be added upon core functionality is attained
Tasks that must be collaboratively tackled: 
* The structure of the classes that will be creating must be agreed upon collectively, and still needs some thought.
* Finding the best csv file
* Writing the depth-first and backtracking algorithm

Timeline: 
* Once the Station class is deemed workable, then we will try spending about a day or two on putting the stations into Station objects to contain information
* Once this prerequisite is completed, then we will build SubwayLines, which will have an array of Stations that are linked. Methods like getNext() and getPrev() will need to be made.
* We will need to find a way of linking subway stations on different lines, but after that then we can begin our depth-first and backtracking algorithm to find the best path.
* Once this is functional, then we will work on the user-interface part of our project. The user should be able to select a start station and an end station, and receive an estimate of how much time traveling should take.
* Other cool features can be added.
